Description:
Using video of a persons upper body (like on zoom), we will track their hand that's forming a specific gesture. Then we'll employ techniques learned in class to identify the point where the user wants to draw (probably tip of index finger) and then draw a line following the finger. If time allows, we'll also try to implement feature such as erasing, changing colors, etc.


Will - Morphology and feature detection. Finding out where the user wants to draw. Gradient descent along contour of hand to find tip of finger.


Evan - KLT tracking and/or template matching to find/track sample gesture in the video. Using sample images of gestures to find them in the video. 

 
Jaiy - Updating video with drawing. Using pyramiding to reduce computation. Further gesture recognition to change colors, erase, etc.
